# Click 2 Copy Project - Wolfram Institute  

Welcome to the **Click 2 Copy Project**, an initiative by the Wolfram Institute to modernize and enhance the accessibility of the code used to create the iconic figures from Stephen Wolfram‚Äôs *A New Kind of Science (NKS)*. This project empowers contributors to reproduce these figures using updated Wolfram Language code, making it easier to understand and explore the principles behind them.

## üåü Project Overview  

This repository serves as a central hub for the *Click 2 Copy* initiative. It provides:  

- **Links to original figures and relevant pages** in the *NKS* book for context and reference.  
- A **table of progress**, showing which figures have been updated and which still require contributions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute  

We welcome and encourage contributions to this project! Here‚Äôs how you can help:  

1. **Explore the Repository**  
   - View the table of figures to find one that hasn‚Äôt been updated with modern Wolfram Language code.  
   - Each figure links to its corresponding page in the *NKS* book for reference.  

2. **Update or Write Code**  
   - Use modern Wolfram Language to reproduce the figure as accurately as possible.  
   - Ensure your code is clean, concise, and follows the repository‚Äôs contribution guidelines.  

3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Fork the repository, update the relevant files with your code, and submit a pull request.  
   - Include a brief description of your contribution and reference the figure from the table.  
   - Your submission will be reviewed, and once approved, it will be added to the repository and included in the NKS book.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure  

This repository is organized as follows:  

- **`table_of_figures.md`**: A table listing all the figures from the *NKS* book, with links to their corresponding pages and status (updated or pending).  
- **`code/`**: Contains directories for the updated Wolfram Language code files, categorized by chapter.  
- **`contribution_guidelines.md`**: Detailed instructions on how to contribute to the project.  
- **`resources/`**: Supplemental materials, including links to the *NKS* book and documentation on the Wolfram Language.

## üìã Goals  

1. **Accessibility**  
   - Enable users to explore and reproduce *NKS* visuals with a single click.  
2. **Education**  
   - Provide insights into the computational principles behind the figures.
